<h3>Maid of Honor</h3>
<h4>Corinne Klopotek</h4>
<p>Corinne and Marie met in high school because she went to Matt’s high school and they attended prom in the same group. They became close friends when they all attended UW- Eau Claire and were roommates for years! Corinne is studying to become a school psychologist. Corinne knows every Vine ever made and has licked hundreds of envelopes for wedding related invitations. We love Corinne for her relentless humor (mostly dad jokes), huge heart, and positivity in all situations!<br><br>
Fun fact: If you ever see a “road work ahead” sign, RUN. She WILL say, “yeah, I sure hope it does!”
