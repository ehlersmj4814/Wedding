<h3>BRIDE</h3>
<h4>Marie Maghilom Schug</h4>
<p>I grew up in Rudolph, Wisconsin - a town with more cows than people - and attended Assumption High School in Wisconsin Rapids. One of my best friends, Katelyn, dragged me to McDonalds for a blind double date. It went as awkwardly as you might have imagined. Wisconsin weather led me to only see Matt with a winter hat on the first 5-7 times we met, so when I first saw his hair, I genuinely did not recognize him! Matt’s sense of humor, intelligence, kindness, and fun-loving personality made me fall for him hard! Fast forward 5 years: we moved to Eau Claire for college and are getting married! Matt, Corinne, Noah, Ariana, Aaron, Camille, and I went to dinner then watched the ball drop at the Edgewater Hotel in Madison on New Years Eve. When I turned around to kiss Matt at midnight, he was on one knee! He did reach for my right hand instead of my left for the ring. You can look forward to seeing this hilarious moment on our wedding day in our slideshow. Matt has graduated with an informations system degree and is a systems analyst at Cray in Chippewa Falls. He is also a very talented woodworker, and has built me a fireplace, bed, and chest. He is currently working on building our dream kitchen table! I look forward to graduating this December with a degree in Organizational Communication and plan to continue working as the volunteer coordinator at The Community Table in Eau Claire. Matt and I enjoy biking, cooking, skiing and snowboarding, attending concerts, and exploring new places. Since we met, we have embarked on a number of adventures including: skydiving, parasailing, driving segways, exploring Florida, Jamaica, California, Montana, and New York. We are looking forward to our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic!

<h3>GROOM</h3>
<h4>Matthew Joseph Ehlers</h4>
<p>I was born and raised in Niagara, a small town in Northeast Wisconsin. We moved to Wisconsin Rapids in 2008 and I attended the public school there. It wasn't until high school that I formally met Marie. However, our first picture together, which I still have in my room today, is us at confirmation. We officially met through mutual friends at the best place to meet anyone: McDonalds. When I first laid eyes on Marie, she was a sweet ball of energy. I may not have said anything to her on our first date, but I definitely was amazed by her. After warming up to each other, we started to actually talk and hit it off. The rest of our high school years were filled with exploring every park in central Wisconsin, judging which towns had the best playgrounds, and late nights watching movies. After deciding to run off to college together, we continued exploring with our adventurous spirits in Eau Claire. After making the decision to propose to Marie, I decided the best time to do it would be during subzero temperatures near a lake in Madison on New Years Eve. We are looking forward to honeymooning in the Dominican Republic after celebrating our marriage with our friends and family!</p>
